# Building Defence

## Introduction

This is a typing game implemented in ruby. This game is based on the first computer game(run on DOS) I met when I was a child. I tried to find that game to reunion  my childhood, but failed. One day, it came to me "Why write it myself?". That's it!

## How to play

1. `cd this_directory`
2. `ruby building_defence.rb`

That's it!

Recommend you play this game with full screen.
